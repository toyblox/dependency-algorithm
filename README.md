# dependency-algorithm


*A software package can be installed when all of its dependencies have been installed, or when it doesn't have any dependencies at all.

*When a package has already been resolved, we don't need to visit it again.

*A circular dependency is occurring when we see a software package more than once, unless that software package has all its dependencies resolved.
